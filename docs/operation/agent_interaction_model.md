NCS Agent Interaction Model v0.1
Purpose

Define how multiple agents participate in a decision process.

Participation Rules

Multiple agents may interact with the same decision.

Each agent may:

.propose a solution

.critique a proposal

.support a version

.raise an objection

.request revision

Influence Principles

Agents do not control decisions individually.
Decisions evolve through interaction.

Support accelerates stabilization.

Critique introduces evaluation pressure.

Blocking objections prevent finalization.

Agreement emerges through convergence, not authority.

Collective Stability Condition

A decision becomes stable when:

no blocking objections remain

critiques have been addressed

sufficient support exists

Core Principle

Intelligence is collaborative, not isolated.
