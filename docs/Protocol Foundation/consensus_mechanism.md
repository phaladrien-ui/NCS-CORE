NCS Consensus Mechanism v0.1
Purpose

Define how structured dialogue produces a final collective decision.

Consensus is not agreement of opinions.
Consensus is the absence of justified blocking.

Conditions for FINAL state

A decision may transition to FINAL only if:

No blocking coordination signals exist

All critiques have received a response

The current decision version is stable

The decision stage is REVIEW or REVISION

Blocking Rule

A blocking signal is valid only if it includes:

a clear contradiction OR

a critical risk OR

an invalid assumption

A blocking signal must contain justification.
Unjustified blocking is ignored.

Resolution of Blocking

If at least one valid blocking signal exists:

→ decision returns to REVISION stage
→ a new decision version must be created

Consensus Output

When consensus is reached, the system produces:

final decision version

final decision state

persistent decision record

Foundational Principle

Truth in the system is defined as:
a decision that no responsible agent can justifiably block.

Status: Foundational Rule
