Decision Lifecycle — NCS Core

A decision evolves through strict stages.

STAGE 1 — PROPOSED
A new solution is introduced.

STAGE 2 — REVIEW
Other agents critique the proposal.

STAGE 3 — REVISION
Proposal is modified based on critiques.

STAGE 4 — FINAL
No blocking objections remain.

Rules:

.Every decision has a version number

.Any revision increments version

.A blocking objection prevents FINAL

.All transitions must be recorded
