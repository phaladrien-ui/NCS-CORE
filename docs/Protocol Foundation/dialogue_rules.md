NCS Dialogue Rules v0.1

Purpose
Define how structured messages interact to produce collective decisions.

Core Principles

Every proposal must receive at least one critique before FINAL.

A blocking signal must include justification.

Consensus exists only when no blocking signals remain.

Messages must reference the current decision version.

Revisions must respond to critiques explicitly.

Dialogue is sequential and recorded.
